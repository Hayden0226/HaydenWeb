# Personal Website

> **Note:** This entire project was generated using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). Not a single line of code was manually written - everything from the architecture to the implementation was created through AI-assisted development.

A modern, privacy-focused personal website built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, featuring integrated activity tracking from various platforms.

## Features

### Core Features
- 📝 **Blog** with markdown support and tagging
- 📄 **Papers/Publications** section for research work
- 💼 **Projects** showcase with 143 Project Euler solutions
- 👨‍💻 **Work Experience** page with resume
- 🔐 **PGP Key** page for secure communication
- 🐾 **Pet Gallery** with image galleries

### Activity Tracking
- 🎮 **Gaming** - Track games across Steam, PlayStation Network, and Nintendo Switch via Exophase
- 🎵 **Music** - Display recently played tracks from Spotify
- 🎬 **Movies** - Show watched films from Letterboxd
- 📺 **TV Shows** - Track watched shows via a TMDB list with ratings
- 📺 **Anime** - Track anime watching from MyAnimeList
- 📚 **Books** - Display reading list from Goodreads

### Ambient Audio System
- 🎵 **Per-page composed music** — each page has its own unique song with distinct melody, bass line, chords, tempo, and key (like different Pokemon city themes)
- 🎹 **Step sequencer engine** — plays composed songs using `[midiNote, durationIn16ths]` patterns with multi-track support (melody, bass, pad, arp)
- 🎛️ **Theme-reactive audio** — visual themes dramatically alter the music's pitch, oscillator type, envelope, filter, reverb, and distortion via live parameter ramping (no audio interruption)
- 🔊 **12 distinct songs** spanning 60–140 BPM across major, minor, and Pythagorean scales
- 🔇 **Toggle & volume control** — persisted in localStorage, with smooth crossfades between songs on page navigation

### Technical Features
- 🛡️ Security-first approach with CSP, HSTS, and other security headers
- 🎨 Responsive design with Tailwind CSS 4
- 🌙 5 built-in themes (Minimal Technical, Modern Glass, Brutalist, Dark Terminal, Academic Minimal) with fully CSS custom property-driven styling

- 🖼️ Dynamic OG image generation
- 🔍 SEO optimized with sitemap generation
- ♿ Accessible design

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22.x (recommended for full compatibility with psn-api)
  - Minimum: 20.x or later (required by psn-api@2.15.0)
  - Cloud Build uses Node.js 22 to match local environment
- **npm** 9.x or later
- **Git** for version control

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atyansh/atyansh-website.git
   cd atyansh-website
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   For new setup, copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   If you have secrets in Google Cloud Secret Manager, sync them instead:
   ```bash
   node scripts/pull-secrets.cjs
   ```

4. **Configure your API keys** (see detailed instructions below)

**Note:** `npm run build` automatically syncs secrets from Secret Manager before building (if gcloud is configured). Secret Manager is the single source of truth.

## Quick Start (Minimal Setup)

You can run the site with minimal or no API keys. The site will gracefully handle missing credentials:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` to see your site.

**Note:** Pages requiring API credentials (games, music, movies, etc.) will show placeholder content or errors until configured.

## API Configuration

All API credentials are optional. Configure only the services you want to use.

### 1. Steam (Gaming Stats)

**What you need:**
- Steam API Key
- Your Steam ID

**Steps:**
1. Get your Steam API key at https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
2. Find your Steam ID:
   - Visit your Steam profile
   - Copy the number from the URL (e.g., `steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198XXXXXXXXX`)
   - Or use https://www.steamidfinder.com/

3. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   STEAM_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   STEAM_ID=76561198XXXXXXXXX
   ```

### 2. PlayStation Network (Gaming Stats)

**What you need:**
- NPSSO token (64-character authentication token)

**Steps:**
1. Log in to https://www.playstation.com in your browser
2. Visit https://ca.account.sony.com/api/v1/ssocookie
3. You'll see a JSON response containing your NPSSO token:
   ```json
   { "npsso": "your_64_character_token_here" }
   ```
4. Copy the 64-character token value

5. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   PSN_NPSSO=your_npsso_token_here
   ```

**Important:**
- Never share your NPSSO token - treat it like a password
- Tokens are valid for 60 days, then need to be refreshed
- Detailed guide: https://bigbudone.com/posts/how-to-get-your-npsso-token-for-playstation-api-access/

4. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   GOODREADS_USER_ID=12345678
   ```

**Note:** Uses web scraping. Your reading list must be public.

### 9. TMDB (TV Show Tracking)

TV shows are tracked directly on TMDB: a public "TV Shows I've Watched" list holds the shows, and TMDB account ratings hold the ratings. The v4 user access token is long-lived, so no refresh flow is needed.

**What you need:**
- TMDB API Read Access Token (v4)
- TMDB user access token, account object id, and list id (generated by script)

**Steps:**
1. Create an account at https://www.themoviedb.org
2. Go to Settings > API and request API access (free for personal use)
3. Copy the "API Read Access Token" into `.env`:
   ```bash
   TMDB_READ_TOKEN=your_read_access_token
   ```
4. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-tmdb.cjs
   ```
5. Approve access in the browser when prompted; the script prints the remaining `.env` values:
   ```bash
   TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN=generated_user_access_token
   TMDB_ACCOUNT_OBJECT_ID=generated_account_object_id
   TMDB_TV_LIST_ID=generated_list_id
   ```

**Tracking shows:** add shows to the list and rate them on themoviedb.org or the TMDB mobile app; the site picks them up on the next build.

### 10. Kaya (Climbing Stats)

**What you need:**
- Your Kaya username

**Steps:**
1. Download the Kaya app and create an account
2. Log your climbs in the app
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   KAYA_USERNAME=your_kaya_username
   ```

**Note:** Uses the public Kaya GraphQL API. No API key required.

### 11. Discord Notifications (API Health Monitoring)

Get notified via Discord DM when API keys expire during automated builds.

**What you need:**
- A Discord bot (create one at https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- The bot must share a server with you (any server works)
- Your Discord user ID

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click **New Application**
2. Go to **Bot** in the sidebar, click **Reset Token**, and copy the bot token
3. Invite the bot to a server you're in — go to **OAuth2**, copy the Application ID, then visit:
   `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID&scope=bot`
4. Get your Discord user ID: open Discord Settings > Advanced > enable **Developer Mode**, then right-click your name and **Copy User ID**
5. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   DISCORD_USER_ID=your_discord_user_id_here
   ```
6. Add both secrets to Google Secret Manager and sync (see [API_HEALTH_MONITORING.md](./API_HEALTH_MONITORING.md) for details)

**What it does:**
- Runs after every build (daily at 2 AM UTC in production)
- Checks if all API integrations succeeded
- Sends you a Discord DM with an embed if any API keys have expired
- Includes exact commands to fix issues

See [API_HEALTH_MONITORING.md](./API_HEALTH_MONITORING.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Development

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`

The dev server includes:
- Hot module reloading
- Automatic page refreshes
- TypeScript error checking

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates optimized static files in the `dist/` directory.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

Preview the production build locally before deployment.

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test          # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
```

Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and cover caching, retry logic, RSS parsing, and utility functions.

## Customization

### Personal Information

1. **Home page**: Edit `src/pages/index.astro`
   - Update name, bio, and links

2. **Navigation**: Edit `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
   - Customize navigation menu
   - Update footer links

3. **Work Experience**: Edit `src/pages/work.astro`
   - Add your work history
   - Update resume link

### PGP Key Setup

1. Generate a PGP key:
   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```

2. Export your public key:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export your.email@example.com > public/publickey.asc
   ```

3. Update key information in `src/pages/pgp.astro`

### Adding Content

Create markdown files in the appropriate directory:

- **Blog posts**: `src/content/blog/post-title.md`
- **Projects**: `src/content/projects/project-name.md`
- **Papers**: `src/content/papers/paper-name.md`

Each content type has a schema defined in `src/content/config.ts`. Follow the existing examples for frontmatter format.

### Disabling Features

To disable specific integrations, simply don't add their API keys to `.env`. The site will gracefully handle missing credentials.

To completely remove a feature:
1. Remove the corresponding page from `src/pages/`
2. Remove the navigation link from `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
3. Remove unused utility files from `src/utils/`
4. Uninstall unused dependencies from `package.json`

## Deployment

This site can be deployed to any static hosting platform:

### Firebase Hosting + Cloud Build (Current Setup)

This site is deployed to Firebase Hosting (Blaze plan) with automated daily builds via Cloud Build. Firebase's global CDN serves the site, purges its cache automatically on every deploy, and manages the TLS certificate for atyansh.com.

**Manual Deployment:**
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**Automated Daily Builds:**
- Cloud Build runs daily at 2 AM PT using a [custom Docker image](#cloud-build-docker-image) with Chrome dependencies pre-installed
- Fetches latest code and API data
- Deploys automatically to Firebase Hosting (`firebase deploy --only hosting`)

See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for full setup instructions.

#### Cloud Build Docker Image

Cloud Build uses a custom Docker image (`gcr.io/personal-website-334502/node-puppeteer:22`) with Chrome dependencies pre-installed. This avoids reinstalling ~25 packages on every build.

To rebuild the image (only needed for Node.js major version bumps or Puppeteer upgrades):
```bash
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-image.yaml .
```

### Vercel (Alternative)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import repository in Vercel dashboard
3. Add environment variables in Vercel project settings
4. Deploy

### Netlify

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import repository in Netlify dashboard
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `dist`
5. Add environment variables in site settings
6. Deploy

### Cloudflare Pages

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Create new Pages project
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Build output directory: `dist`
5. Add environment variables
6. Deploy

### Important for Production

1. **Security headers**: HSTS is enabled in `src/middleware.ts` for non-dev environments. For static hosting, configure security/caching headers in `firebase.json`.
2. **Environment variables**: Add all your API keys to your hosting platform's environment variable settings
3. **Caching**: All API integrations use file-based caching (24-hour TTL) to minimize external requests during builds

## Security Best Practices

This site implements security best practices:

- ✅ **Content Security Policy (CSP)** - Prevents XSS attacks
- ✅ **HSTS** - Enforces HTTPS connections
- ✅ **X-Content-Type-Options** - Prevents MIME sniffing
- ✅ **Referrer Policy** - Controls referrer information
- ✅ **Permissions Policy** - Restricts browser features
- ✅ **Comprehensive .gitignore** - Protects secrets
- ✅ **No client-side tracking** - Privacy-focused
- ✅ **Static site generation** - Minimal attack surface
- ✅ **security.txt** - Responsible disclosure contact

### Protecting Your Secrets

**NEVER commit `.env` to git.** It's already in `.gitignore`, but double-check:

```bash
git check-ignore .env
# Should output: .env
```

If you accidentally commit secrets:
1. Immediately rotate all API keys
2. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
3. Force push the cleaned repository

## Troubleshooting

### API Tokens Expired

**IGDB and MyAnimeList tokens auto-refresh during builds** if you have the required credentials:
- IGDB: Requires `IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET` to auto-refresh
- MyAnimeList: Uses `MAL_REFRESH_TOKEN` to auto-refresh
- TMDB: No refresh needed — the v4 user access token is long-lived
- Refreshed tokens are automatically saved to Secret Manager for future builds

**Spotify tokens expire periodically:**
- Re-run `node scripts/get-spotify-token.cjs` to get new tokens
- Update `.env` with new values
- For production: Sync to Google Cloud with `./scripts/sync-secrets-to-gcloud.sh`

**PSN uses a refresh token flow** to avoid frequent manual renewal:
- The NPSSO bootstraps the refresh token on first use
- Each build uses the refresh token to get a new access token, extending the ~10-day window
- The NPSSO can be invalidated at any time (e.g. logging out of PSN on another device) — the refresh token keeps working until its window expires
- When the refresh token also expires, get a new NPSSO:
  - Log out of https://store.playstation.com, then log back in
  - Visit https://ca.account.sony.com/api/v1/ssocookie to get a fresh token
  - Update `PSN_NPSSO` in `.env` and sync to Secret Manager

**Automated monitoring:**
- If Discord notifications are configured, you'll automatically receive a DM when tokens expire
- The message includes exact commands to fix each issue
- See [API_HEALTH_MONITORING.md](./API_HEALTH_MONITORING.md) for setup

### Web Scraping Issues

**Letterboxd, Goodreads, Exophase, Kaya rely on scraping/public APIs:**
- If these fail, the site structure may have changed
- Check the respective utility file in `src/utils/`
- Update selectors or scraping logic
- Consider implementing caching to reduce requests

### Build Errors

**Missing environment variables:**
- The build will fail if required APIs return errors
- Make sure all API keys in `.env` are valid
- Or disable the failing integration

**TypeScript errors:**
```bash
npm run build
```
Check the console output for specific type errors.

### Port Already in Use

If port 4321 is already in use:
```bash
lsof -ti:4321 | xargs kill -9
npm run dev
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Caching**: All API integrations use a generic `FileCache<T>` with 24-hour TTL, reducing redundant API calls across builds
2. **Build time**: Cloud Build uses a custom Docker image with Chrome dependencies pre-installed, and Letterboxd scraping reuses a single Puppeteer browser instance across pages
3. **Image optimization**: Pet photos and other images are automatically optimized by Astro
4. **Lazy loading**: Activity sections use client-side rendering for faster initial loads
5. **Error resilience**: React components are wrapped with ErrorBoundary to isolate failures
